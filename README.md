### [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/install)

Once installed, you should be able to execute `jupyter-lab` from your terminal, opening a Jupyter Lab instance on your machine. The instance will be hosted on your local machine (defaulted on Windows to `localhost:8888/lab`). 

Once open, you should be able to select an environment for you Notebook from the landing page. At the time of writing, Lab is using Python 3 for its Notebook environment. Select the appropriate icon to get started. 

This will create a `.ipynb` file within the host system.
