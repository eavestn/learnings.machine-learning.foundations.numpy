## Comment On Code

The code seen in this repository is code completed as a part of [Udacity's Introduction to Machine Learning (Tensorflow)](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning-with-tensorflow-nanodegree--nd230?utm_campaign=12712700850_c_individuals) program. Two things to take note when looking at the code in this repository: 

1. This code is largely my own; however, as each segment is completed within the confines of a particular lesson, certain code outlines, shortcuts, or other code quality issues are more-directly related to the curriculum and provided code samples. Where I have been able - and where it does not add a tremendous amount of time to my learning experience - I have lightly refactored some of the base sample to make better sense to me.
2. This code is meant for me; this code is "Notes". It sucks.

## Important Environment Configuration Links

### [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/install)

Once installed, you should be able to execute `jupyter-lab` from your terminal, opening a Jupyter Lab instance on your machine. The instance will be hosted on your local machine (defaulted on Windows to `localhost:8888/lab`). 

Once open, you should be able to select an environment for you Notebook from the landing page. At the time of writing, Lab is using Python 3 for its Notebook environment. Select the appropriate icon to get started. 

This will create a `.ipynb` file within the host system.
